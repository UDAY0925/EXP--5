## CRUD Operations for Product Database Using Mongoose
# Introduction

# Objective

The main objective of this project is to understand how to:

Connect a Node.js application with MongoDB using Mongoose.

Design and validate a database schema.

Implement CRUD operations using Express routes.

Handle input validation and errors effectively.

# Tools and Technologies

Node.js

Express.js

Mongoose

MongoDB

Nodemon

# System Requirements

Node.js and npm installed on the system

MongoDB running locally or hosted on MongoDB Atlas

Any API testing tool such as Postman

# Implementation Steps

Initialize a Node.js project and install dependencies using npm install.

Connect to MongoDB using Mongoose.

Define a Product schema with fields: name, price, and category.

Implement Express routes for CRUD operations:
